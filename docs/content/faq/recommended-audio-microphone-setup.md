Karaoke Hydra makes no assumptions about audio input so that it can work with any mic setup (including none at all). To mix the player's output (the music) with mics, there are generally 2 approaches:

  - Software mixing: The system running the player uses a USB or Thunderbolt audio interface that has mic(s) connected.
  - Hardware mixer: An external/outboard mixer has mic(s) connected, as well as the audio from the system running the player.
