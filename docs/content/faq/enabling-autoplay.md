Most browsers block media from playing automatically unless the webpage has been interacted with in some way, which can cause issues when starting the player remotely. See the following links for enabling auto-play on your browser:

*   **Chrome:** [Change site settings permissions](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/114662){{% icon-external %}} and set Sound to "Allow".
*   **Firefox:** [Allow or block media autoplay](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/block-autoplay){{% icon-external %}} and set Autoplay to "Allow Audio and Video".
*   **Safari (macOS):** [Customize settings](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/stop-autoplay-videos-ibrw29c6ecf8/mac){{% icon-external %}} and set Auto-Play to "Allow All Auto-Play".
*   **Edge:** [Allow or block media autoplay](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/learning-center/manage-autoplay){{% icon-external %}} and set Media autoplay to "Allow".
