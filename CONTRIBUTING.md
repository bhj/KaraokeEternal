# Contributing to Karaoke Hydra

## Quick Guide

### I found a bug

First, search [existing issues](https://github.com/Zardoz8901/KaraokeEternalAutomated/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/Zardoz8901/KaraokeEternalAutomated/discussions) — your issue might have already been reported or fixed.

If not, open an [Issue Triage](https://github.com/Zardoz8901/KaraokeEternalAutomated/discussions/new?category=issue-triage) discussion. Include:
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Browser/environment details

### I have a feature idea

Open a [Feature Request](https://github.com/Zardoz8901/KaraokeEternalAutomated/discussions/new?category=feature-requests) discussion.

### I have a question

Open a [Q&A](https://github.com/Zardoz8901/KaraokeEternalAutomated/discussions/new?category=q-a) discussion.

### I'd like to contribute code

All [issues](https://github.com/Zardoz8901/KaraokeEternalAutomated/issues) are actionable. Pick one and start working on it. If you need guidance, comment on the issue.

## Issues are Actionable

**Users cannot create Issues directly** — please create a Discussion first.

Unlike some projects, this repository does not use the issue tracker for discussion or feature requests. Instead, we use GitHub Discussions. Once a discussion reaches a point where a well-understood, actionable item is identified, it is moved to the issue tracker by the maintainer.

**This pattern makes it easier for contributors to find issues to work on since _every issue_ is ready to be worked on.**

Any Discussion which clearly identifies a problem and can be confirmed will be converted to an Issue by the maintainer — you don't do any extra work.

## Pull Requests

PRs should be associated with a previously accepted Issue. If you open a PR for something that wasn't previously discussed, it may be closed or remain stale.

Before submitting:
1. Reference the Issue number in your PR
2. Run `npm run lint && npm test`
3. Keep commits atomic and focused

## Development Environment

```bash
nix develop
npm install
npm run dev
```
